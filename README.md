ex1 ----  draw a plane with dip direction = 20 and E of N and dipping 30  degrees
          draw the pole to the plane mentioned above，
          draw a small circle centered at an azimuth of 280 degrees, plunging 40 degrees and 20 degrees in diameter
          画了断层面为倾向以及倾角，接着画了极轴，又画了一个滑动方位角为280，滑动角为40 半径为20
          
ex2 ----  draw a plane with dip direction = 135 and E of N and dipping 61  degrees  rake=0

ex3 ----  draw a plane with dip direction = 190 and E of N and dipping 45  degrees  rake=260

ex4 ----  draw a plane with dip direction = 135 and E of N and dipping 61  degrees  rake=180

ex5 ----  draw a plane with dip direction = 135 and E of N and dipping 61  degrees  rake=90
          
0 degrees represents a left handed strike slip fault. 

90 is a pure thrust, 

180 a right handed strike slip,

270 a pure normal fault.
